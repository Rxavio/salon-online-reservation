<h3><i>Humans are visual beings who love to reinvent themselves through design and art even in the littlest parts of their bodies like their nails, which is why glitter nails and other nail art designs were invented. 
Some people who want to have their own personalized nail art go to nail bars or spas just to have it done.

Nail art is the art of decorating fingernails and toenails with different designs using nail polish and other embellishments.
 If you are just starting with nail art, it is best to have short nails, as it is the best canvas you can have.
 With a bit of buffing, a touch of color, and a dab of sparkly polish, you can create the best glitter nails you could ever wish for.

Nail art is a great way to spice up an outfit. 
It can change a woman is personality every day.
 Nail art can be hard to do, especially when you are no artist, but there are professionals who offer this kind of service. 
 Nevertheless, DIY nail art tutorials are now easily accessible through video sharing sites like YouTube and other websites especially dedicated to beauty and fashion.
